# Governance Model

Omnipair uses a **two-layered governance model** that balances **market-driven decision-making** with **token-holder regulation**:

- **Futarchy proposals** — open markets where anyone can participate using USDC, steering key protocol decisions through economic incentives.
- **Vote-based governance** — restricted to OMFG holders, acting as a regulatory body to manage protocol-level settings and permissions.

This layered approach allows:

- **Permissionless experimentation** at the pool level.
- **Market-optimized decisions** through futarchy.
- **Token-holder oversight** on systemic parameters.

Each layer has distinct powers and responsibilities, working in tandem to protect the protocol while enabling decentralized evolution.
