# Protocol Governable Parameters

> Omnipair's contracts are immutable — they cannot be upgraded or modified after deployment. However, **OMFG governance still controls a set of meta-parameters**, allowing it to regulate the system without interfering with its core logic.

**1. Protocol-Level Fees**

- **Governance fee** → Paid into Omnipair treasury
- **Team fee** → Capped and transparently directed to the team

Both fees are adjustable by governance.

**2. Pool Governance Settings**

Governance does not directly control individual pools but instead regulates the rules by which pool creators can modify them:

- **Vetoing Timelocked Actions** — All changes initiated by pool creators go through a delay period. During that time, a futarchy vote can **veto** the action.
- **Changing Governance Parameters** — Governance can adjust:
  - Timelock duration
  - Proposal fee
  - Bond size (which can be slashed)

This structure transforms governance into a **regulatory layer**, not a central controller.
