# What is OMFG?

**Om**nipair **F**utarchy **G**overnance token (**OMFG)** is the governance token of Omnipair. It empowers the community to regulate the protocol's behavior without interfering with its immutable smart contracts.

Omnipair leverages **futarchy via** [**MetaDAO**](https://metadao.fi/)— decisions are made through prediction markets, letting the market choose the best course of action rather than relying on simple voting. Omnipair's governance model is double-layered:

1. **Futarchy proposals** — open to any market participant
2. **Vote-based governance** — exclusive to OMFG holders

Futarchy has the upper hand, holding control over two critical authorities:

- The **treasury**
- The **OMFG mint authority**

Think of it as **governance governed by markets**.

Vote-based OMFG governance plays a more regulatory role over GAMM pools. Read more in [Vote-based Governance](/governance/governance-model)
