# Leveraging

## Leveraging Overview

Omnipair allows users to efficiently gain leveraged exposure to any token pair through **recursive borrowing** within isolated pools. Unlike traditional margin exchanges or lending protocols, Omnipair is permissionless and does not rely on external oracles, enabling leverage even on long-tail assets.

### How Recursive Leverage Works:

To achieve leverage, a user follows these steps within the same pool:

1. **Deposit Token0 as collateral**.
2. **Borrow Token1 against deposited collateral** (up to collateral factor limits).
3. **Swap borrowed Token1 to Token0** (increasing exposure to Token0).
4. **Repeat steps 1-3** to multiply exposure.

This iterative process effectively magnifies exposure to the desired asset, limited by the **Collateral Factor (CF)** of the pool:

$$
\text{Maximum leverage} = \frac{1}{1 - CF}
$$

For example, if (CF = 85%), maximum leverage achievable is:

$$
\frac{1}{1 - 0.85} = 6.67\times
$$

### Advantages of Omnipair's Leveraging Model:

- **Permissionless:** No governance approval needed for new asset leverage.
- **Isolated risk:** Each pair operates independently, eliminating cross-pool risk.
- **Efficient utilization:** Liquidity is continuously productive.
- **No oracles:** EMA price mechanisms eliminate oracle manipulation risks.

Leveraging through Omnipair enables sophisticated trading strategies and capital efficiency unavailable in traditional AMMs or lending protocols.
