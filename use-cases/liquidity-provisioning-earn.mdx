# Liquidity Provisioning (Earn)

Interest flows directly into the reserve — meaning LPs benefit automatically without active management.

## Streaming Collateral (Liquidations)

If a borrower becomes insolvent:

- Their debt is written off
- Their collateral is streamed into the pool reserves over time
- This avoids reserve volatility and protects LPs from dump risk

## Risk Profile

| Risk             | Explanation                                    | Mitigation                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Impermanent Loss | Applies during volatile swaps, similar to AMMs | Offset by borrow interest                  |
| Credit Risk      | Borrowers may default                          | EMA pricing + isolated pools + CF caps     |
| Liquidity Lock   | Excessive utilization can slow LP withdrawals  | Dynamic interest rate incentivizes balance |

## LP Withdrawals

When you remove liquidity:

- You receive back your pro-rata share of Token0 and Token1
- Withdrawals check solvency: pool must remain collateralized
- If utilization is too high, part of your liquidity may be temporarily "locked" (as borrowed funds)

## Design Rationale

- **Unified pool** = better capital efficiency
- **Streamed liquidations** = smoother LP experience
- **Interest model** = rewards LPs without volatility

## Summary

LPs in Omnipair earn like both Uniswap LPs and Aave lenders — all in one position. While risks are present, they're transparent and isolated per pair, with protective design choices to keep capital safe and productive.
